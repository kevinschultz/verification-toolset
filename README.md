# verification-toolset
 Queries used for sunapsis verification toolsets - or best guesses, anyway since the current version is broken and won't reveal them!

 As of 9/25/2024 the latest version of Sunapsis (4.2.11.1) will let you run Verification Checks and will give you a count of records that are of a concern, but the previous functionality that let you click to open the query and view the results doesn't work. For sunapsis admins who want to look into the issues, I've come up with what the queries likely are - most of them are pretty simple!
